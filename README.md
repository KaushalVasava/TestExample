# TestExample
It is a project in which you will learn android Testing using JUnit4 and other testing library.

-> Instrumentation tests run on a device or an emulator. In the background, 
your app will be installed and then a testing app will also be installed 
which will control your app, lunching it and running UI tests as needed.

-> Instrumentation tests can be used to test none UI logic as well.
They are especially useful when you need to test code that has a dependency on a context.

In this project we will test json read from phone using Junit4.
