# TestExample
It is a project in which you will learn android Testing using JUnit4, Espresso, mockito testing library.

You will learn how to test retrofit api calling and how to test api in this branch. 
I used mockwebserver for testing server and mock-response for testing user defined response.
  
API Testing :

-> Test cases:  
  1. Empty response
  2. Dummy or success response (200)
  3. Error response(400-499)
  
Web MockServer Advantages: 

- Rate limiting :
    Rate limiting are there for real server, but using mock server you can raise many requents as you want and check response accordingly.
- Cost :
    Many server has request cost, so using this we can eaise request locally and save api request cost.
- Faster developement :
    When your api is not ready and you know request and response format of api, then you can easily test your api and develope your app.
- Testing scenario like timeouts, 4xx,5xx errors : 
    You can easily mock server according to your response.
